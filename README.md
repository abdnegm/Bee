Your cousin has extra free time due to the quarantine and virtual school isn’t challenging enough? Do you want your kid to be the next 🏆Gokul Venkatachalam🏆? Use 🅱️ee 🐝, a website that provides exceptional spelling bee practice.

## How to Use 🐝

You begin by picking one of two modes:

-Practice (default): You are given a word and must type it in correctly
-Challenge: You are given a word and must type it in correctly within the given time limit (2 minutes). If you get one character wrong, you immediately get the question wrong

Then, you must pick a difficulty level, which ranges based on skill level. There are several buttons that emulate the functionalities of a normal spelling bee:

-View Word: The correct spelling is automatically inputted into the text box
-New Word: You are given a new word, which is automatically pronounced aloud
-Repeat Punctuation: The word is spoken aloud again
-Definition: The definition is displayed
-Part of Speech: The part of speech is displayed
-Sentence: An example sentence is displayed
